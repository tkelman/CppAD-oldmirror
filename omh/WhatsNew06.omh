$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2005
(in reverse order by date).
Changes and additions to CppAD during previous years can be found in
$table
$tref WhatsNew03$$ $rnext
$tref WhatsNew04$$ $rnext
$tref WhatsNew05$$ 
$tend
The purpose of these sections is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 02-04$$
There was a read memory access past the end of an array in
$xref/CppAD_vector/push_back/CppAD::vector::push_back/$$.
This has been fixed and in addition
$xref/TrackNewDel/$$ is now used to do and check the allocation in 
$code CppAD::vector$$.
$pre

$$
The routines $xref/Runge45/$$ and $xref/Rosen34/$$
had static vectors to avoid recalculation on each call.
These have been changed to be plain vectors to avoid memory
leak detection by $xref/TrackNewDel/TrackCount/TrackCount/$$.

$head 01-20$$
Add 
$xref/WishList/Software Guidelines/software guidelines/$$
to the wish list.

$head 01-18$$
Improve the definition for 
$xref/glossary/Parameter/parameters/$$ and
$xref/glossary/Variable/variables/$$.
Remove unnecessary reference to parameter and variable
in  documentation for $xref/Independent/$$.

$head 01-08$$
$index aclocal$$
The aclocal program is part of the automake and autoconf system.
It often generates warnings of the form:
$syntax%
	/usr/share/aclocal/%...%: warning: underquoted definition of
	%...%
%$$
The shell script file $code FixAclocal$$,
which attempts to fix these warnings,
was added to the distribution.

$head 01-07$$
Change CppAD error handler from using the macros defined in
$code CppAD/CppADError.h$$ to using a class defined in 
$xref%ErrorHandler%%CppAD/ErrorHandler.h%$$.
The macros $code CppADUnknownError$$ and $code CppADUsageError$$
have been depreciated (they are temporarily still available in the 
file $code CppAD/local/CppADError.h$$).

$head 01-02$$
Add the sed script $code Speed/gprof.sed$$ to aid in the display of the
$xref/InstallUnix/--with-profiling/--with-profiling/$$ output.
$pre

$$
Make the following source code files easier to understand:
$code Add.h$$, $code Sub.h$$, $code Mul.h$$, $code Div.h$$
(in the directory $code CppAD/local$$).

$head 01-05$$
Make the following source code files easier to understand:
$code RevSparseHes.h$$,
$code Reverse.h$$,
$code Fun.h$$,
$code Forward.h$$,
$code ForSparseJac.h$$,
$code RevSparseJac.h$$
(in the directory $code CppAD/local$$).
