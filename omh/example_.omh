$head Introduction$$
This section organizes the information related to the CppAD examples.
Each CppAD operation has its own specific example,
for example $xref/Add.cpp/$$ is an example for $xref/Add/$$.
Some of the examples are of a more general nature
(not connected of a specific feature of CppAD).
In addition, there are some utility functions that are used
by the examples.

$head Running Examples$$
The 
$xref/Install//installation instructions/$$
show how the examples can be run on your system.


$head Choosing CppADvector$$
Many of the examples use the $xref/CppADvector/$$ preprocessor symbol 
to determine which $xref/SimpleVector/$$ template class is used with
the examples.
