$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2009$$


$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2009
(in reverse order by date).
The purpose of this section is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 09-21$$
The configure instructions for $cref/IpoptDir/InstallUnix/IpoptDir/$$
had the wrong path for $code IpIpoptApplication.hpp$$.
This has been fixed.

$head 09-20$$
Upgrade to from autoconf 2.61 to 2.63,
and from automake 1.10.1 to 1.11.
$pre

$$
Fix conflict between CppAD's use of config.h preprocessor symbols
and other packages use of the same symbol names. 

$head 06-06$$
Using complex of an AD type (instead of AD of complex) was not working
correctly in $cref/not_complex_ad.cpp/$$ because the 
$cref/default/Default/$$ constructor for an AD object has an unspecified value.
This has been fixed for the complex type by changing the default constructor
to use value zero. 
$pre

$$
Fixing the $code not_complex_ad.cpp$$ problem above also fixed a warning
generated by $href%/http://valgrind.org/%valgrind%$$.
Now $code valgrind$$ runs the CppAD $code example/example$$ program
with out any warning or error messages.
In addition, a minor initialization error was fixed in the
$code test_more/jacobian.cpp$$ routine so now 
$code valgrind$$ also runs the CppAD $code test_more/test_more$$ program
with out any warnings or error messages.

$head 05-20$$
A change was make to the trunk on 05-19 (svn revision 1361) that broke the
$cref/Unix install/InstallUnix/$$ procedure.
This was has been fixed (revision 1362).

$head 03-24$$
Added cross references in 
the $cref/examples/ListAllExamples/$$ to occurrence of the following tokens:
$cref/AD/$$,
$cref/ADFun/FunConstruct/$$,
$cref/CPPAD_TEST_VECTOR/test_vector/$$,
$cref/Forward/$$,
$cref/Independent/$$,
$cref/Jacobian/$$
$cref/NearEqual/$$,
$cref/Reverse/$$.

$head 02-20$$
Demonstrate using AD to compute the derivative
of the solution of an ODE with respect to a parameter
(in the $cref runge_45_2.cpp$$ example).

$head 02-15$$
Change the distribution
$cref/tar files/InstallUnix/Download/Unix Tar Files/$$
to only contain one copy of the documentation.
Link to the current Internet documentation for the other three copies.


$head 02-01$$
Move the $code Prev$$ and $code Next$$ buttons at the top of the documentation
to the beginning so that their position does not change between sections.
This makes it easier to repeatedly select this links.


$head 01-31$$
Modify $code cppad/local/op_code.hpp$$ to avoid incorrect warning by
g++ version 4.3.2 when building $code pycppad$$ (a python interface to CppAD).

$head 01-18$$
Sometimes an error occurs while taping AD operations.
The $cref/abort_recording/$$ function has been added 
to make it easier to recover in such cases.
$pre

$$
Previously, CppAD speed and comparison tests used Adolc-1.10.2.
The version used in the tests has been upgraded to
$href%
	http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~adol-c/%
	Adolc-2.0.0.
%$$
$pre

$$
A discussion has been added to the documentation for $cref/Jacobian/$$ 
about its use of
$cref/forward or reverse/Jacobian/Forward or Reverse/$$
mode depending on which it estimates is more efficient.
$pre

$$
A minor typo has been fixed in the description of
$cref/W(t, u)/reverse_any/W(t, u)/$$ in $cref/reverse_any/$$.
To be specific, 
$latex o ( t^{p-1} ) * t^{1-p} \rightarrow 0$$
has been replaced by
$latex o ( t^{p-1} ) / t^{1-p} \rightarrow 0$$.

$head 01-06$$
Made some minor improvements to the documentation in
$cref/FunConstruct/$$.
