$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2007$$


$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2007
(in reverse order by date).
The purpose of this section is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 04-06$$
Working in $code branches/intro$$ (again).

$subhead 04-07$$
Added a preliminary version of $cref/exp_2_rev2/$$
(does not yet have verification or exercises).

$subhead 04-06$$
Fixed a problem with the Microsoft Visual Studio project file 
$code introduction/exp_apx/exp_apx.vcproj$$
(it did not track the file name changes of the form 
$code exp_apx/exp_2_for$$ to $code exp_apx/exp_2_for1$$ 
on 04-05).
$pre

$$
Added $cref/exp_2_for2/$$ to introduction.

$subhead 04-05$$
Use order expansions in introduction; e.g., the
$cref/second order expansion/exp_2_for2/Second Order Expansion/$$ 
for the $cref/exp_2/$$ example.

$head 03-31$$
Merge in changes made in $code branches/intro$$
and remove the corresponding Introduction item from the wish list:

$subhead 03-31$$
Create the a simpler exponential approximation in the $cref/introduction/$$
called $cref/exp_2/$$ which has a different program 
variable for each variable in the operation sequence.
$pre

$$
Simplify the $cref/exp_eps/$$ approximation using the
$latex v_1 , \ldots , v_7$$ notation so that variables directly
correspond to index in operation sequence (as with the $cref/exp_2/$$ 
example).

$subhead 03-30$$
The Microsoft project file $code introduction/exp_apx/exp_apx.vcproj$$
was referencing $code exp_apx_ad.cpp$$ which no longer exists.
It has been changed to reference $code exp_apx_cppad.cpp$$
which is the new name for that file.


$head 03-29$$
Fixed entries in this file where the year was mistakenly used for the month.
To be more specific, $syntax%07-%dd%$$ was changed to $syntax%03-%dd%$$
for some of the entries directly below.
$pre

$$
Corrected some places where $code CppAD$$ was used in stead of $code Adolc$$
in the $cref/adolc_poly.cpp/$$ documentation.
$pre

$$
Added an Introduction and 
$cref/Tracing/WishList/Tracing/$$ entry to the wish list.
(The Introduction item was completed on $cref/03-31/whats_new_07/03-31/$$.)

$head 03-20$$
$cref/Example A.1.1c/example_a11c.cpp/$$,
from the OpenMP 2.5 standards document,
was added to the tests that can be run using $cref/openmp_run.sh/$$.

$head 03-15$$
Included the changes from openmp branch
so that so CppAD does not use the OpenMP $code threadprivate$$ command
(some systems do not support this command).

$subhead 03-15$$
Add command line arguments to $cref/multi_newton.cpp/$$, and
modified $cref/openmp_run.sh/$$ to allow for more flexible testing. 

$subhead 03-14$$
Fixed some Microsoft compiler warnings by explicitly converting from 
$code size_t$$ to $code int$$.
$pre

$$
In the Microsoft compiler case, the $code cppad/config.h$$ file had 
the wrong setting of $code GETTIMEOFDAY$$.
The setting is now overridden (and always false) when the 
$code _MSC_VER$$ preprocessor symbol is defined.
$pre

$$
Some minor changes were made in an effort to speed up the multi-threading case.

$subhead 03-13$$
Started a new openmp branch and created a version of CppAD 
that does not use the OpenMP $code threadprivate$$ command
(not supported on some systems).

$head 03-09$$
Included the changes from openmp branch
so that OpenMP can be used with CppAD,
see $cref/omp_max_thread/$$.
The changes
dated between $cref/02-15/whats_new_07/03-09/02-15/$$ and 03-28 below
were made in the openmp branch and transferred to the trunk on 03-09.


$subhead 03-28$$
The conditional include commands were missing on some include files; 
for example
$codep
	# ifndef CPPAD_BENDER_QUAD_INCLUDED
	# define CPPAD_BENDER_QUAD_INCLUDED
$$
was missing at the beginning of the $cref/BenderQuad/$$ include file.
This has been fixed.
$pre

$$
The $code speed_test$$ routines $cref/timing/speed_test/Timing/$$ was
changed to use $code gettimeofday$$ if it is available.
($code gettimeofday$$ measures wall clock time 
which is better in a multi-threading environment).
$pre

$$
Added the user multi-threading interface
$cref/omp_max_thread/$$ along with its examples 
which are distributed in the directory $code openmp$$.
$pre

$$
The $syntax%speed/%*%.hpp%$$ files have been moved to
$syntax%cppad/speed/%*%.hpp%$$ and the corresponding wish list
item has been removed.
$pre

$$ 
The multiple tapes with the same base type wish list item 
have been removed (it's purpose was multi-threading which
has been implemented).


$subhead 02-27$$
The $cref/speed/$$ include files are currently being distributed
above the $code cppad$$ include directory. 
A fix this wish list item has been added.
$pre

$$
Multiple active tapes required a lot of multi-threading access
management for the tapes. This was made simpler (and faster)
by having at most one tape per thread.


$subhead 02-22$$
The include command in the $cref/speed_test/$$ documentation was
$codep
	# include <speed/speed_test.hpp>
$$
but it should have been
$codep
	# include <cppad/speed_test.hpp>
$$
This has been fixed.

$subhead 02-17$$
An entry about $cref/optimizing/WishList/Optimization/$$ the operation
sequence in an $cref/ADFun/FunConstruct/$$ object was added.
$pre

$$
Change the argument syntax for $cref/Dependent/$$ and deprecate the 
$cref/old Dependent syntax/FunDeprecated/Dependent/$$.


$subhead 02-16$$
Added $syntax%VecAD<%Base%>%$$ as a valid argument type for the
$cref/Parameter and Variable/ParVar/$$ functions.
In addition, $cref/size_t indexing/VecAD/size_t Indexing/$$
is was extended to be allowed during taping so long as the
VecAD object is a parameter.


$subhead 02-15$$
Fixed the $code example/test_one.sh$$ script 
(it was using its old name $code one_test$$).

$head 02-06$$
The $cref BenderQuad$$ documentation was improved by adding the fact
that the $italic x$$ and $italic y$$ arguments to the $syntax%f%.dy%$$
member function are equal to the $italic x$$ and $italic y$$ arguments
to $code BenderQuad$$. Hence values depending on them can be stored
as private objects in $italic f$$ and need not be recalculated.

$head 02-04$$
The method for distributing the documentation needed to be
changed in the top level $code makefile.am$$ in order to
be compatible with automake version 1.10.

$head 02-03$$
The change on $cref/02-01/whats_new_07/02-01/$$ had a new, saved as a static
pointer, with no corresponding delete. 
This was not a bug, but it has been changed to avoid
an error message when using CppAD with 
$href%http://valgrind.org/%valgrind%$$.
$pre

$$
The change to the $code pow$$ function on
$cref/06-12-10/whats_new_06/12-10/$$ did not include the
necessary changes to the $cref/Sparsity/Sparse/$$ calculations.
This has been fixed.

$head 02-02$$
Fix minor errors and improve
$cref/profiling/InstallUnix/--with-profiling/$$ documentation.
Also change the problem sizes used for the $cref/speed/$$ tests.

$head 02-01$$
There seems to be a bug in the cygwin version of g++ version 3.4.4
with the -O2 flag whereby some static variables in static member functions 
sometimes do not get constructed before being used. This has been
avoided by using a static pointer and the new operator in cppad/local/ad.hpp.

$head 01-29$$
The copyright message was missing from some of the distribution files
for some new files added on $cref%06-12-15%whats_new_06%12-15%$$.
This resulted in the 
$cref%unix%InstallUnix%Download Current Version%$$
and
$cref%windows%InstallWindows%Download Current Version%$$
download files not existing for a period of time.
The automated tests have been extended so that this should not happen again.
