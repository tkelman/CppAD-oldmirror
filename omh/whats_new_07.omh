$section Changes and Additions to CppAD During 2007$$


$head Introduction$$
This section contains a list of the changes to CppAD during 2007
(in reverse order by date).
The purpose of this section is to
assist you in learning about changes between various versions of CppAD.

$head 02-22$$
In the openmp branch (not yet in distribution),
the include command in the $cref/speed_test/$$ documentation was
$codep
	# include <speed/speed_test.hpp>
$$
but it should have been
$codep
	# include <cppad/speed_test.hpp>
$$
This has been fixed.

$head 02-21$$
In the openmp branch (not yet in distribution),
have added the user interface change the
$cref/maximum number of active tapes/max_active/$$.
This needs to be tested in a multi-threading environment to
be sure that it works there.
Then the openmp branch changes can be copied to the trunk.


$head 02-17$$
In the openmp branch (not yet in distribution),
a entry about $cref/optimizing/WishList/Optimization/$$ the operation
sequence in an $cref/ADFun/FunConstruct/$$ object was added.
$pre

$$
Change the argument syntax for $cref/Dependent/$$ and deprecate the 
$cref/old Dependent syntax/FunDeprecated/Dependent/$$.


$head 02-16$$
In the openmp branch (not yet in distribution),
added $syntax%VecAD<%Base%>%$$ as a valid argument type for the
$cref/Parameter and Variable/ParVar/$$ functions.
In addition, $cref/size_t indexing/VecAD/size_t Indexing/$$
is was extended to be allowed during taping so long as the
VecAD object is a parameter.


$head 02-15$$
In the openmp branch (not yet in distribution),
fixed the $code example/test_one.sh$$ script 
(it was using its old name $code one_test$$).

$head 02-06$$
The $cref BenderQuad$$ documentation was improved by adding the fact
that the $italic x$$ and $italic y$$ arguments to the $syntax%f%.dy%$$
member function are equal to the $italic x$$ and $italic y$$ arguments
to $code BenderQuad$$. Hence values depending on them can be stored
as private objects in $italic f$$ and need not be recalculated.

$head 02-04$$
The method for distributing the documentation needed to be
changed in the top level $code makefile.am$$ in order to
be compatible with automake version 1.10.

$head 02-03$$
The change on $cref/02-01/whats_new_07/02-01/$$ had a new, saved as a static
pointer, with no corresponding delete. 
This was not a bug, but it has been changed to avoid
an error message when using CppAD with 
$href%http://valgrind.org/%valgrind%$$.
$pre

$$
The change to the $code pow$$ function on
$cref/06-12-10/whats_new_06/12-10/$$ did not include the
necessary changes to the $cref/Sparsity/Sparse/$$ calculations.
This has been fixed.

$head 02-02$$
Fix minor errors and improve
$cref/profiling/InstallUnix/--with-profiling/$$ documentation.
Also change the problem sizes used for the $cref/speed/$$ tests.

$head 02-01$$
There seems to be a bug in the cygwin version of g++ version 3.4.4
with the -O2 flag whereby some static variables in static member functions 
sometimes do not get constructed before being used. This has been
avoided by using a static pointer and the new operator in cppad/local/ad.hpp.

$head 01-29$$
The copyright message was missing from some of the distribution files
for some new files added on $cref%06-12-15%whats_new_06%12-15%$$.
This resulted in the 
$cref%unix%InstallUnix%Download Current Version%$$
and
$cref%windows%InstallWindows%Download Current Version%$$
download files not existing for a period of time.
The automated tests have been extended so that this should not happen again.
