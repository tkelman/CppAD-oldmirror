$section Routines That Speed Test CppAD$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if 
certain changes improve its execution speed.
This section explains how you can run these tests on your computer.


$head Unix$$
In a unix operating system (or in a Cygwin shell on an Microsoft system),
you must first configure CppAD to run its speed tests.
To do this, run the install
$xref/InstallUnix/Configure/configure/$$ command with the
$code --with-Speed$$ command line option included.
You can then compile link and run the speed 
tests with the following commands (relative to the distribution directory):
$codep
	cd Speed
	make 
	./Speed
$$

$head Windows$$
In Microsoft Visual Studio open the project file 
$code Speed/Speed.sln$$
(relative to the distribution directory).
Then set the configuration to the $code Release$$ version.
Then select $code Build | Speed$$.
