$section The CppAD Speed Tests$$

$head Purpose$$
CppAD has a set of speed tests that are used to determine if 
certain changes improve its execution speed
(and to compare CppAD with other AD packages).
This section links to the source code the CppAD speed tests
(any suggestions to make the CppAD results faster are welcome).


$head Speed$$
To run these tests, you must include the
$code --with-Speed$$ command line option during the
$cref/install configure/InstallUnix/Configure/$$ command. 
After the Unix install $cref/make/InstallUnix/make/$$ command, 
you can then run the CppAD speed tests 
with the following commands (relative to the distribution directory):
$codep
	speed/cppad/cppad correct
$$
This will check that the speed tests have been built correctly.
You can run the command
$codep
	speed/cppad/cppad all
$$
to see the results of all the speed tests.
See $cref/speed_main/$$ for more options.
