# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define your subversion commit by editing the definition of 
# log_entry, add_list, change_list, delete_list and copy_branch below.
#
# log_entry
# The contents of this variable will be used as the log entry for the commit.
#
# add_list
# List of files that will be added to the repository during this commit.
# Do not use add_list to add directories; use the following instead:
# 	svn add --non-recursive dir
# 	svn commit directory -m "adding directory dir" dir
# where dir is replaced by the name of the directory. 
# Then use add_list to add the files within that directory.
#
# change_list
# List of files that are currently in repository and change during this commit.
#
# delete_list
# List of files that will be deleted from the repository during this commit.
#
# copy_branch
# You may specify up one other branch (not the trunk and currently in memory) 
# that should receive a copy of all that changes that you are making with this 
# commit. If copy_branch is empty; i.e., copy_branch="", the changes will not
# be copied (and commited) into another branch.
#
log_entry="Control of memory allocated for Taylor coefficients

CapTaylor.h: implement control as capacity_taylor ADFun member function.
ADFun.h: define capacity_taylor and change taylor_size to size_taylor.
FunConstruct.h: mention implicit zero order calculation during constructor.
Forward.h: include CapTaylor.h and use taylor_capacity.
Reverse.omh: change cross reference from taylor_size to size_taylor.
Forward.omh: taylor_size->size_taylor and add mention of capacity_taylor.
WhatsNew06.omh: change cross reference from taylor_size to size_taylor.
FunDeprecated.omh: add taylor_size to this list.
Forward.cpp: add calls to capacity_taylor in example.
Makefile.am: add CapTaylor.h
