# Change CppAD/branches/Brad (do not affect trunk):
# Fold the 24 comparision operators into one case by encoding the result value 
# and operand types into an index field (similar to CondExp.h).
# This will make it easier to add the rest of the sparsity calculations.
#
# ADTape.h: add prototype for RecordCompare ADTape member function.
# ForJacSweep.h: fold the 24 comparison cases into "case ComOp:".
# ForwardSweep.h: fold the 24 comparison cases into "case ComOp:".
# ReverseSweep.h: fold the 24 comparison cases into "case ComOp:".
# TapeRec.h: improve PutInd by having all cases up to 6 indices,
#            make all of these cases very similar code,
#            add index entries for each of the member functions,
# Operator.h: fold the 24 comparison cases into "case ComOp:".
# Declare.h: add CompareNe to the CompareOp enum type.
# AD.h: declare GreaterThanOrZero to be a friend.
# Ordered.h: add GreaterThanOrZero function.
# CompareOp.h: this requried a total rewrite and is now similar to CondExp.h.
