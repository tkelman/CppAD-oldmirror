# Edit section above for individual cases, section below stays the same
# Do not use add_list to add directories; use the following instead:
#	svn add --non-recursive dir
#	svn commit directory -m "adding directory dir" dir
# where dir is replaced by the name of the directory. 
# Then use add_list to add the files within that directory.
