/*!
Prototype for forward mode unary operator, never called.

\tparam Base
base type for the operator; i.e., this operation was recorded
using AD<Base> and computations by this routine are done using type Base.

\param p
order of the Taylor coefficient that we are computing.

\param i_z
variable index corresponding to the result for this operation; 
i.e. the row index in taylor corresponding to z. 

\param i_y
variable index corresponding to the argument for this operator;
i.e. the row index in taylor corresponding to y.

\param nc_taylor
number of colums in the matrix containing all the Taylor coefficients.

\param taylor
\b Input: taylor[ i_y * nc_taylor + j ] 
is the j-th order Taylor coefficient corresponding to y for j = 0 , ... , p.
