$head Description$$
The template class
$syntax%AD<%Base%>%$$ 
is defined by including 
the file $xref/CppAD//CppAD.h/$$.
The purpose of this class is to record 
$syntax%AD<%Base%>%$$ operations on a corresponding tape 
so that derivatives can be calculated.
The sections listed below describe the methods
that are available for objects in this template class.
